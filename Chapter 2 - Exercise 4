-- greater than 10,000, sorted by total value.

SELECT 
orderid 
,SUM (quantity * unitprice) AS totalvalue

FROM Sales.Orders

GROUP BY  -- needed because of aggregate function SUM
orderid

HAVING SUM(quantity * unitprice) > 10000   -- HAVING used to filter grouped values/aggregates 
ORDER BY totalvalue DESC;
